## Introduction

The ATM Machine project is a simple application that simulates an ATM machine's functionality. The user can enter their PIN and select from a menu of available transactions, such as withdrawing cash or checking their balance. The project is built using Java and uses object-oriented programming principles to model the ATM machine's behavior.

## Installation
To run the ATM Machine application, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/Dasari1672/atmmachine.git
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ)
- Build the project using the IDE's build/run tools or by running the Main.java file in the src folder.
- Follow the prompts in the console to interact with the ATM machine.

## Usage
The ATM Machine supports the following transactions:

- Checking account balance
- Withdrawing cash
- Depositing cash
- Changing PIN

To use the ATM Machine, follow these steps:

- Enter your PIN when prompted
- Select the transaction you want to perform from the menu
- Follow the prompts to complete the transaction
